An open source Voxel Game/Engine written in Rust with Bevy.

I'll admit, it's not very well written, and it's not complete, but it might give someone some ideas on how to do certain things. I worked pretty hard on this for about a month, then got burnt out, so I figured I'd make it available to the public for use.
